# --- Summary ---
#
# This is the input file for fac-fma-rawfield.py script
# this script reads a fieldmap from a 3D magnet model, stores it
# for latter analysis and prints and plots basic information on the
# field map. It is used to quickly inspect the fieldmap


# --- Input parameters ---

# Each analysis has an identity label used for naming output files

config_label                  'B1-analysis'


# The next parameter specifies the type of magnet to be analysed.
# each type may have its own particular algorithms to be applied

magnet_type                   'dipole'


# the full name of the file that contains the field map

# Runge-Kutta algorithm that is used for the integration of the eqs.
# of motion needs to know what to do when trajectory reaches the
# fieldmap bounds. It will either extrapolate the field along the
# longitudinal (z) direction or consider it to have vanished. This
# is controlled with the parameter below. Bear in mind that the 
# calculation of extrapolation coefficients is very time-consuming
# currently. As for the transverse directions (x and y), the RK 
# algorithm will generate exceptions.
